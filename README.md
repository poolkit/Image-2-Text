## Image Captioning
Image Captioning is the process of generating textual descriptions of an image. It is a challenging task in the field of computer vision and natural language processing. The goal of Image Captioning is to create a model that can generate a natural language description of an image, which should be accurate, relevant, and semantically meaningful.

This repository contains the code for building an Image Captioning model using Deep Learning. The model is trained on the Flickr30k dataset which contains a large collection of images with corresponding textual descriptions. The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract features from the images and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to generate the textual descriptions.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tensorflow 2.x
